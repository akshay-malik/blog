      <description>Why is this useful ? Initially, difference between transportation modes and transportation options described here may seem to be semantic at first. But if examined closely, it reveals significant implications on how transportation infrastructure gets analyzed, financed, managed and delivered to users. It also points to wider impacts on other planning functions such as land use planning, local tax policy and real estate development. The goal is to provide an alternative way of classifying all the choices people have today to transport goods and people, especially in the urban setting.</description>
