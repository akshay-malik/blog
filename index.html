    Why make a blog This question is reasonable as there are several options such as Medium or Wordpress that can help one get setup with a blog without much trouble. The reasons I decided to setup my own blog are as follows:
Show off R skills  - I wanted to have a blog specifically to show off data science work. Setting up a blog using Rstudio provides me with a straight forward R project to get started on.

    Having worked for the City for over two years, I have had the pleasure and priveledge of working with a group of hard working and talented government employees. This time and interaction has allowed me to see that lack of resources has caused several people hours to go waste in doing tasks that should clearly be automated. This situation encouraged me to start this running list of systems that the City needs desperately.

    This difference between transportation modes and choices or options described here may seem to be cosmetic at first. But if studied closely, this has implications on how transportation infrastructure gets financed, managed, delivered to users and it impact evaluated on other urban metrics such as land use. Today, it has become difficult and critical to manage the transportation infrastructure in the City because of the following factors:
an increase in the number of travel options or choices a rise in data exchange to share availability of service for each option in real-time growing entanglement among these travel choices to form complex journeys for each user.
