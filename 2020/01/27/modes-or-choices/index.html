<h3>Changes in Urban Mobility Landscape</h3>
<p>This difference between transportation modes and choices <em>or options</em> described here may seem to be semantic at first. But if examined closelt, it reveals significant implications on how transportation infrastructure gets analyzed, financed, managed and delivered to users. It also points to wider impacts on other planning functions such as land use planning, local tax policy and real estate development.</p>

<div id="changes-in-urban-mobility-landscape-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Changes in Urban Mobility Landscape</h3>
<p>Today, it has become difficult and critical to manage the transportation infrastructure in the City because of the following three factors:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>an increase in the number of travel options or choices</em></li>
<li><em>a rise in data exchange to share availability of service for each option in real-time</em></li>
<li><em>growing entanglement through use of smart phones among these travel choices to form complex journeys for each user across a shared physical landscape.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The last point here is the most important to unpack. Entanglement refers to interconnection and interdependence of different choices of travel to support a user in moving across urban areas. One may take an electric scooter to the nearest subway and then take a train to their destination while paying for both through their smart watch. Hence today’s urban interconnected infrastructure is no longer restricted to the cart-way or the sidewalk but includes our smart phones and smart cards as well. This inter-dependence between the <strong>physical realm</strong>, where we move, and the <strong>virtual realm</strong>, where we share our information, demands better coordination from people who manage it. If one were to extend this idea of data-driven coordination to City governments or public transit agencies, these agencies may seem far from delivering anything substantial on it.</p>
</div>
<div id="difference-and-impact" class="section level3">
<h3>Difference and Impact</h3>
<p>Traditional transportation research and modelling practices have used broad classifications of transportation geography as a basis for analyzing transportation systems in the past. In the case of <em>road transportation</em>, a car is <strong>a single mode</strong> of transportation.</p>
<p>Think about these four scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drive your own car</li>
<li>Drive someone else’s car <em>(Zipcar)</em></li>
<li>Be driven by someone else in their car <em>(Uber/Lyft)</em></li>
<li>Take a taxi <em>(Yellow Cab)</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each <strong>choice</strong> here, from a perspective of transportation demand modelling, uses the same traditional <strong>mode</strong> of <em>‘driving a car’ on a public street</em>, but has different ownership arrangements, and more importantly, different data infrastructures supporting each of them. Trains and trolleys, although they have similar ownership structure at a higher level and fall under the mode of ‘public transit’, their data infrastructure is quite different from an operations perspective and hence are two different travel choices.</p>
