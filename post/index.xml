      <description>Why make a blog This question is reasonable as there are several options such as Medium or Wordpress that can help one get setup with a blog without much trouble. The reasons I decided to setup my own blog are as follows:
Show off R skills  - I wanted to have a blog specifically to show off data science work. Setting up a blog using Rstudio provides me with a straight forward R project to get started on.</description>
