<p>I like the execise of naming events in general because it helps one give thought to what is the event about and how is it relevant to one's time or space.. This blog is named <em>shan-n-bhang-oor</em>, which means <em>something that gets destroyed in an instant</em>. The origin of my thinking about this particular word comes from my conversations with my first boss and good friend, George Attokaran. He initiated a conversation between us with the question, <strong>what is the design theme of our times?</strong></p>
<p>My answer to this question was the word  <strong>क्षणभंग</strong> because everything around me in terms of not only designs and systems, but also in terms of human internactions, was tending to become ever more ephemaral and evanescent. I am working on a post expanding on my thoughts about this word and how it defines the future of the modern times I live in. The link to that post will soon be placed here.</p>
